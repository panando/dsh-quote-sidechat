// @panando/dsh-quote-sidechat — host half.
//
// Intentionally inert. Every behaviour of this plugin (the floating toolbar
// over a text selection, the 「添加到对话」 action and its write into the
// composer draft) lives in the browser half, lib/client.js.
//
// Why a host half exists at all: the DSH client-modules scanner only publishes
// a browser bundle for packages that are *enabled Loader entries*
// (cordis.patch.yml below). There is no host-only-free client plugin.
//
// Persistence note: this version stores its small config in the browser's
// localStorage (`dsh.quote-sidechat.v1`), matching the official sidebar-right /
// conversation view-state precedent. To make the config survive a browser
// switch, give the entry below a `Config` with one `.volatile()` JSON string and
// read it from the browser half through
// `ctx.configForms.get('quote-sidechat')`;
// the client half funnels every read/write through `readConfig`/`writeConfig`,
// so that swap stays local to lib/client.js.
